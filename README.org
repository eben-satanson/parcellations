* Notes
- PDF and BIB files: file:./aux-refs/
- Parcellations/annotations file:./aux-annots/fsaverage/label/
- All parcellations transformed to =fsaverage=:
  - =?h.aparc.annot=
    - Desikan-Killiany Atlas parencite:&r2006PaperDesikanEtAlN2
    - Available as a standard option in FreeSurfer/MNE distribution
  - =?h.aparc_sub.annot=
    - A more detailed version of the Desikan-Killiany Atlas
      parencite:&r2006PaperDesikanEtAlN2
    - Includes sub-parcellations based on
      textcite:&r2018PaperKhanEtAlN2
      - QUOTE: *Cortical parcellation (labels)* /FreeSurfer was
        used to automatically divide the cortex into 72 regions/
        parencite:&r1999PaperDaleEtAlN2. /After discarding “medial
        wall” and “corpus callosum”, these regions were further
        divided in to a total of N = 448 cortical “labels (Fig.
        S4)”, so that each label covers a similar area again using
        FreeSurfer. _We employed this high-resolution parcellation
        scheme because cortical surface is very convoluted and
        averaging across a large label, which crosses multiple
        sulci and gyri, can result in signal cancellation across
        the parcel_. Lastly, _a high-resolution parcellation also
        reduces the dependence of the results on the specific
        selection of the parcels_./
    - NB: Recently used in textcite:&r2025PaperRuuskanenAvendano-DiazN1
      - Sub-parcellations were methodologically justified in the
        context of addressing the same problem we face
      - QUOTE: *Cortical parcellation* /To decrease computational
        complexity and increase interpretability, we employed a
        cortical parcellation to reduce the dimensionality of the
        source-space data. To that end, the data were organized
        into 448 ROIs as defined in the aparc sub parcellation
        scheme developed by Khan and colleagues
        parencite:&r2018PaperKhanEtAlN2 based on the
        Desikan–Killiany atlas/.
      - QUOTE: /The time courses within each ROI were then
        averaged to form a representative time series. To prevent
        signal cancellation at the opposite sides of sulci, a
        sign-flip operation was applied to the signals of the
        sources whose orientation differed from the dominant
        direction within the ROI by more than 90◦. The use of a
        relatively dense parcellation further reduces signal
        cancellation and flattening during the averaging
        procedure/.

      - BTW: ↓ Not a bad template for localization visualization (if
        one adds a histogram to such circle).
      - [[file:aux-imgs/r2025PaperRuuskanenAvendano-DiazN1-img-0002.png]]
    - NB: Interesingly, both textcite:&r2018PaperKhanEtAlN2 and
      textcite:&r2025PaperRuuskanenAvendano-DiazN1 relied on =?h.aparc_sub.annot=
      to solve a problems very similar to the ones we
      discossed today.
    - =BTW: ?h.aparc_sub_FIXED.annot= contains manually corrected label strings.
  - =?h.HCPMMP1.annot=
    - From textcite:&r2016PaperGlasserEtAlN1
    - A strong alternative candidate for consideration.
    - =?h.HCPMMP1_ORIG.annot= is OK
  - =?h.power.annot=
    - From textcite:&r2011PaperPowerEtAlN2
    - Not a preferred option for my taste (although, just in case,
      please find it in the fsaverage space)
    - This parcellation is highly non-uniform in parcel size; some
      areas are very small, while others cover large cortical
      surface regions (likely due to idiosyncratic data used, which
      may reflect their specific research constrains but is suboptimal for
      exploring new data).
