  abstract = {Recent studies have confirmed that white matter hyperintensities (WMHs) accumulated in strategic brain regions can predict cognitive impairments associated with Alzheimer’s disease (AD). The knowledge of white matter anatomy facilitates lesion-symptom mapping associated with cognition, and provides important spatial infor­ mation for lesion segmentation algorithms. However, deep learning-based methods in the white matter hyper­ intensity (WMH) segmentation realm do not take full advantage of anatomical knowledge in decision-making and lesion localization processes. In this paper, we proposed an anatomical knowledge-based MRI deep learning pipeline (AU-Net), handcrafted anatomical-based spatial features developed from brain atlas were integrated with a well-designed U-Net configuration to simultaneously segment and locate WMHs. Manually annotated data from WMH segmentation challenge were used for the evaluation. We then applied this pipeline to investigate the association between WMH burden and cognition within another publicly available database. The results showed that AU-Net significantly improved segmentation performance compared with methods that did not incorporate anatomical knowledge (p {$<$} 0.05), and achieved a 14–17\% increase based on area under the curve (AUC) in the cohort with mild WMH burden. Different configurations for incorporating anatomical knowledge were evalu­ ated, the proposed stage-wise AU-Net-two-step method achieved the best performance (Dice: 0.86, modified Hausdorff distance: 3.06 mm), which was comparable with the state-of-the-art method (Dice: 0.87, modified Hausdorff distance: 3.62 mm). We observed different WMH accumulation patterns associated with normal aging and cognitive impairments. Furthermore, the characteristics of individual WMH lesions located in strategic re­ gions (frontal and parietal subcortical white matter, as well as corpus callosum) were significantly correlated with cognition after adjusting for total lesion volumes. Our findings suggest that AU-Net is a reliable method to segment and quantify brain WMHs in elderly cohorts, and is valuable in individual cognition evaluation.},

  abstract = {Real-world complex systems may be mathematically modeled as graphs, revealing properties of the system. Here we study graphs of functional brain organization in healthy adults using resting state functional connectivity MRI. We propose two novel brain-wide graphs, one of 264 putative functional areas, the other a modification of voxelwise networks that eliminates potentially artificial short-distance relationships. These graphs contain many subgraphs in good agreement with known functional brain systems. Other subgraphs lack established functional identities; we suggest possible functional characteristics for these subgraphs. Further, graph measures of the areal network indicate that the default mode subgraph shares network properties with sensory and motor subgraphs: it is internally integrated but isolated from other subgraphs, much like a “processing” system. The modified voxelwise graph also reveals spatial motifs in the patterning of systems across the cortex.},

  abstract = {Julius Caesar Arantius first described the hippocampus and proposed the term               hippocampum               . Years later, French anatomists called the structure ram’s horns, and a decade later, it was named cornu ammonis. Although both concepts were first associated with the same structure, their use has expanded to include different but related structures. This situation can make understanding and applying the terminology more difficult. The objective of this work was to determine the presence of the terms               hippocampus               ,               cornu ammonis               and their variants in               Terminologia Anatomica               ,               Terminologia Neuroanatomica               , and               Terminologia Histologica               , evaluating their congruence in said terminologies, in addition to examining the etymology of both terms. We searched               Terminologia Anatomica               ,               Terminologia Neuroanatomica               , and               Terminologia Histologica               for terms containing the concepts               hippocampus               ,               cornu ammonis               , and their derivatives. We analyzed the terms               hippocampus               and               cornu ammonis               from their etymology by examining several Latin texts. This analysis included the dissection of the hippocampus and fornix and a review of the RAT rules. The etymological analysis indicated that the               hippocampus               refers to a sea horse; however, the term also has a mythological background.               Cornu ammonis               , on the other hand, refers to the horns of an Egyptian god. The terminologies present discrepancies regarding the terms derived from               hippocampus               and               cornu ammonis               . Although both terms appear in various terminologies, they are mythonyms that fail to describe the structure they refer to or meet the requirements set by FIPAT.},

  abstract = {In this paper we describe and validate a longitudinal method for whole-brain segmentation of longitudinal MRI scans. It builds upon an existing whole-brain segmentation method that can handle multi-contrast data and robustly analyze images with white matter lesions. This method is here extended with subject-specific latent variables that encourage temporal consistency between its segmentation results, enabling it to better track subtle morphological changes in dozens of neuroanatomical structures and white matter lesions. We validate the proposed method on multiple datasets of control subjects and patients suffering from Alzheimer’s disease and multiple sclerosis, and compare its results against those obtained with its original cross-sectional formulation and two benchmark longitudinal methods. The results indicate that the method attains a higher test–retest reliability, while being more sensitive to longitudinal disease effect differences between patient groups. An implementation is publicly available as part of the open-source neuroimaging package FreeSurfer.},

A desirable feature for such segmentation methods is to be robust against changes in acquisition platform and imaging protocol. In this paper we validate the performance of a segmentation algorithm designed to meet these requirements, building upon generative parametric models previously used in tissue classification. The method is tested on four different datasets acquired with different scanners, field strengths and pulse sequences, demonstrating comparable accuracy to state-of-the-art methods on T1-weighted scans while being one to two orders of magnitude faster. The proposed algorithm is also shown to be robust against small training datasets, and readily handles images with different MRI contrast as well as multi-contrast data.},

  abstract = {The functional significance of resting state networks and their abnormal manifestations in psychiatric disorders are firmly established, as is the importance of the cortical rhythms in mediating these networks. Resting state networks are known to undergo substantial reorganization from childhood to adulthood, but whether distinct cortical rhythms, which are generated by separable neural mechanisms and are often manifested abnormally in psychiatric conditions, mediate maturation differentially, remains unknown. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG) to map frequency band specific maturation of resting state networks from age 7 to 29 in 162 participants (31 independent), we found significant changes with age in networks mediated by the beta (13–30 Hz) and gamma (31–80 Hz) bands. More specifically, gamma band mediated networks followed an expected asymptotic trajectory, but beta band mediated networks followed a linear trajectory. Network integration increased with age in gamma band mediated networks, while local segregation increased with age in beta band mediated networks. Spatially, the hubs that changed in importance with age in the beta band mediated networks had relatively little overlap with those that showed the greatest changes in the gamma band mediated networks. These findings are relevant for our understanding of the neural mechanisms of cortical maturation, in both typical and atypical development.},
